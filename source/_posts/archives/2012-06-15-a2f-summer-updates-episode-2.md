Here is our second installment of our "Minnesodes." These past few weeks, we kicked off our Multiply Your Talents (MYT) classes, as well as prepared for and had our Interhigh and Joytrek Retreat with EFC. Thanks to the many who helped out in the preparations, and prayed for the retreat. It was definitely a very memorable experience for all of us as well as the youth at EFC.
