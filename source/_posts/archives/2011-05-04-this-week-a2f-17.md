title: 'This Week @ a2f'

---

Wow, I can't believe it's the last week of instruction already!  This year sure flew by fast.  This week, we'll be having our last on-campus Bible study for the semester.  We'll still be meeting throughout the summer, of course, but this Friday marks the end of a2f's first academic year at the U, so we'll be celebrating with a special Bible study.  You can help make it even more special by filling out [this survey](https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?hl=en&amp;formkey=dDg4QXdkX1BneGFILXBZSU1aV1JIb2c6MQ#gid=0)!  See you there!
