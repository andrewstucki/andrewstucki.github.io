We kicked off another action-packed weekend at a2f with our weekly dinner and TFN Bible study.  Pastor Timothy brought a message from Ephesians 2 on the Bible's unique perspective that man is both the pinnacle of creation and yet dead in his transgressions, but God saved us by grace and is at work to restore His image in us.  Afterwards, we went outside to the lawn in front of Coffman and played several games of ultimate frisbee.

As you can see, I'm not very athletic (guy in brown), so I just kind of stood around on the field, donating blood to the campus mosquitoes.  Everyone had a great time, though!

On Saturday, the staff started the day with our morning devotionals, and then decided to buffet our bodies ([1 Cor. 9:27, ASV](http://bible.cc/1_corinthians/9-27.htm)) by going to Kings Restaurant, a Korean buffet in St. Paul.

Our [Gracepoint Austin](http://www.gracepointaustin.org/) brothers, Bryan Song and David Lee, generously generously treated us to that meal--thanks guys!  Then, we headed over to the [Minnesota History Center](http://www.mnhs.org/index.htm) to learn about all those who have come before us to this state, and the legacy they left behind.

Finally, we rounded out the day by taking a quick stroll in the Mall of America.

There is certainly a lot of fun things to see and do here in the Twin Cities.  We hope to explore more interesting places and take everyone along in the future!
