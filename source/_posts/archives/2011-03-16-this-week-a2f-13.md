Hi everyone, hope you are all enjoying a relaxing spring break!  We certainly had a blast this past weekend at our getaway.  Pictures will be up soon!

Since Coffman is still closed, we'll be meeting this Friday at **Pastor Timothy's house** for our TFN Bible Study.  We'll start at 7pm with a delicious dinner, as usual.  Please contact a staff member if you need a ride!
