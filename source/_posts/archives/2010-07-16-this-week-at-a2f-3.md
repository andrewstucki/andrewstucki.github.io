Past meals not guarantee of future results.  Your meal may vary :)

Sorry for the late update, but this week we are back at our regular Bible study time and location, 6:30 pm at 303 Coffman.  As always, we'll start with a delicious meal and rockin' praise, and we'll learn together from the Word of God.  The text this week will be [Philippians 4:4-13](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=phil%204:4-13&amp;version=NIV), if you'd like to get a head start and read it before hand.  See you soon!
