![Don't be intimidated by the sight of these awesome athletes.  You don't have to be athletic.  Or awesome. Just come and have a good time with us!](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4140/4944366112_9f4a73e9d0.jpg)

This week, we'll be back to our regular location at 303 Coffman, starting at our usual time, 7 pm.  Afterwards, we'll be having a fun games night at the Van Cleve park gym in Dinkytown.  Please bring a change of clothes and shoes so you can run around comfortably!
