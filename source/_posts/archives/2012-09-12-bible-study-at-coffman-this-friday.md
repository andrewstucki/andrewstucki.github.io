title: 'Bible Study at Coffman this Friday'

---

Happy hump day everyone! Hope you are all hanging in there and not suffering from second-week syndrome. Its common to experience a decrease in productivity following that first week of school when you were extra motivated.

Well we here at A2F have the perfect cure: The Friday Night Bible Study!Â There is, however, a room change. We normally meet in the President's Room, but for this week only, we will be in the **Mississippi Room**. Everything else is staying the same, though. We will still be there at 7PM, and dinner will be ready and waiting upon your arrival, and we will be following up bible study with a fun fellowship activity that you wont want to miss! Hope to see you there!
