This Friday, we will be having our bible study on campus in the President's Room (3rd floor of Coffman) at 7PM. We will be continuing through our message series in Mark. Afterwards, for our post-TFN activity, we will be preparing for our annual Valentines Day of Compassion. If you haven't heard already, Valentines Day of Compassion is something we do each year on Valentines Day (February 14) to reach out to our community and share with them God's love. As the day is coming soon, we will be using our fellowship time this Friday to prepare gifts, skits, and songs!

If you haven't signed up to join us next Tuesday and you would like to, you can [sign up here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?hl=en_US&amp;formkey=dHY2WXVXMWhLTHJMOVJ6RGFZWm92N1E6MQ#gid=0). Even if you can't make it, feel free to stick around and help us on Friday! It will be a great time of just hanging out!
