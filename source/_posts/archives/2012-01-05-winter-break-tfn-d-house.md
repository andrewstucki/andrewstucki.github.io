Hi Everyone! First off, Happy New Year! Hope you guys are all having a very restful and refreshing winter break. For those of you who are still in the Metro area, we will be having TFN at the D House for the remainder of the break. As usual, we will start at 7PM with dinner, so if you need a ride to TFN, please contact one of the staff members or leave a comment, and we will arrange a ride for you. As usual, we will have a fun post-TFN activity, so hope you guys can make it!
