title: 'Christmas Unwrapped - Special Talk this Friday'

---

Hi all; this Friday, join us at the usual TFN time and place (7pm, President's Room on the 3rd floor of Coffman) to hear a special talk about Christmas, particularly relevant as we look forward to finishing our finals and celebrating Christmas here or at home.Â  Invite your friends to one of our last special events of the year!

Afterwards, we'll have a gift exchange. Bring a gift from $7-10 (no gag gifts) and be ready to have some fun, because this is not like the gift exchange at your Aunt's house...
