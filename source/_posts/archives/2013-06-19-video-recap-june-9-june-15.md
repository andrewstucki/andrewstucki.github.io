Why does Dana look so sad? Sarah discovers that she has a sister that she never knew about? Find out what happens in this week's video recap produced by Dana and Sarah.

The last part of the video may seem random but it's something from the [Truth Project](http://www.thetruthproject.org/ "The Truth Project") which we've been going through every Friday. Aside from the great stuff that we've been learning, there was one part that freaked all of us out where a little girl was used to talk about the wonders of creation.

A lot of us will be heading out to California to attend Gracepoint Summer Rally. It will be a special time as we'll be commissioning the team for Gracepoint Los Angeles.
