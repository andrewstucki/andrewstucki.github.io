title: 'TONIGHT - Freshman Refresh! and Bowling + Board Games'

---

Hope everyone had a great first week back on campus!  Here at a2f it's been non-stop fun all week, with HOT spots, Foodpalooza, and Winter Welcome Night!  Comment on your favorite event!

But If you haven't been able to come to anything yet, no worries.  Tonight we have our special "Freshman Refresh," starting at 7pm at The Whole (Coffman basement), where first-years can connect with one another over some food and games.  After that, we've rented out Goldy's Gameroom for a night of Bowling and Board Games--free to everyone!  Please spread the word and bring your friends!
