title: 'RECAP: Cardboard Camelot'

---

It was a hard fought road for theseÂ corrugated warriors, but in the end it was a blast for everyone involved! We had an awesome time preparing our champions for the games with various boxes and lots of tape. And we had an even better time and watching them compete in the games, cheering on our teams. Through a tug-of-war, an obstacle course, and a gauntlet of school-stressed, pillow-wielding attackers, the cardboard knights were put to the test. There were hard falls, broken shields, and maybe a few broken cardboard dreams, but it was a TFN to remember.
