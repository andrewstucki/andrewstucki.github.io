Wow, I can't believe the summer's already over!  We here at a2f are glad to see everyone back for another exciting semester at the U, and especially want welcome all the new freshmen and junior transfers!  The U is a huge place, so if you're new in town and want to make some new friends at fun events with FREE food, look no further than acts2fellowship!  Whether you're into ultimate frisbee, board games, bowling, or Korean taco truck (yeah, betcha never seen one of those), we've got something for you.  Check out our calendar of upcoming events on the left, and pencil them into your calendar.  Hope to see you there!
