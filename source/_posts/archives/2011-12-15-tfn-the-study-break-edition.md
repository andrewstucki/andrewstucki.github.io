Looks like the semester is coming to an end. How can we tell? The shrink-wrap is finally coming off of those textbooks and students are actually studying! Take a break from the stress of finals and join us for our last campus bible study of 2011 at the President's room at 7pm this Friday. We will be finishing our message series titled "Ever Wonder Why?" After that, we will be having an open study hall for all those who need to study (which I am sure is the majority of the students), so feel free to bring your books and invite your friends, because it is always better to study with others than alone. Plus, we will have delicious snacks!
