title: 'SPECIAL TALK: How Can a Good God Allow Evil?'

---

This Friday, we are having a very special talk at the Mississippi Room! Josiah will be bringing us the message and addressing the question "How Can a Good God Allow Evil?" We'll be starting at 7PM with a nice home-cooked meal, and as usual, we will have a really fun fellowship activity after the talk! Be sure to invite your friends and we'll see you there on Friday!
