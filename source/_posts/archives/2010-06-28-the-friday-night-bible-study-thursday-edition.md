Hi everyone, just to change things up this week, we're going to have our TFN Bible study on **THURSDAY**!  It'll be at the same time (6:30 pm) and same location (303 Coffman), but we'll meet one day early since the staff will be gone this weekend for a retreat.  Hmm, maybe we should call it "TTN" instead.  Please note the date change, and we'll see you there!

By the way, the main text for the Bible study will be Philippians 1:12-30.  You can read it [here](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=phil%201:12-30&amp;version=NIV)
