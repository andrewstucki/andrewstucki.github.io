Hey everyone, Welcome Week is drawing to a close, but here at a2f we're just getting started!  We've been having a blast at our Board Games and Bubbling Italian Soda night, Frisbee and Free Pizza Friday, and the Shaved Ice and Sports events!  Due to some technical difficulties, the pictures aren't up yet, but they will be posted soon.  In the mean time, check out another trailer for our exciting New Student Welcome Night!  Don't miss out on a night with free food, live music, a video and skit, and a presentation introducing our group.  Hope to see you all at NSWN 2010!
