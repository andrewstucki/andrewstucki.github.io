Congratulations to all of you who are done with finals!  Wow, can't believe the fall semester is already behind us.  If you're headed home soon, we wish you a restful winter break with family and friends.  If you're still around on Tuesday, we'll be having our Bible study at Pastor Timothy's house, starting at 6:30 pm with dinner.  Please contact a staff member for rides.  Hope to see you there!
