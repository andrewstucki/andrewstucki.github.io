Have some time during lunch?  Wanna bite to eat with some friends without waiting in line for half an hour?  Then come to LIFE Cafe!  We've been meeting every day, from 12-1 pm at the CUBE in Coffman (near the Starbucks on the ground floor).  Drop in any time for a FREE simple lunch and stimulating conversation!
