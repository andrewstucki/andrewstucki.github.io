title: 'Welcome to Acts 2 Fellowship!'

---

For all of the Freshmen, transfer students, and returning students, welcome to The U! And while we're in greeting mode, welcome to Acts 2 Fellowship! A2F is a campus Christian group at the University of Minnesota. We first started in 2010 and are now entering our third year on this campus, and we welcome all of you to our group! If you would like to learn more about our group, we invite you to browse around our site, check out the pictures, read about some of our past events, or send us an e-mail with your questions or comments. We also have a short video for you to watch that gives you more information about our group, and you can find that video at the top of this page!

We have quite a few events lined up for Fall and especially during welcome week. Be sure to stay up to date with all of these events on our website as well as our [Facebook Page](http://www.facebook.com/a2fminnesota). It is going to be a fun-filled few weeks, but the one that you wont want to miss is our [New Student Welcome Night](http://www.facebook.com/events/126226510857219/)!

We are excited to have you here at the U of M, and we are looking forward to meeting you this fall!
