title: 'TFN and TC Practice'

---

Hi Everyone! For those of you who were at the Thanksgiving Retreat, welcome back! Our schedule will be returning back to a bit of normalcy with TFN being on Friday this week. It will be in Coffman 303 @ 7PM, and we will continue our message series "Follow Me." We will continue studying the Gospel of Luke, and we will also be continuing our Thanksgiving Celebration practice! Don't look now, but TC is just around the corner! We will be working hard preparing for the big day, so hope you can make it. Here is a quick recap video of our first TC practice to wet your appetite (or maybe just remind you what the dance moves are).
