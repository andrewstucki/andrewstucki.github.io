Hey everyone, while the sun is still shining, we're gonna head out to Minnehaha Park for a BBQ picnic, hiking, sports, and maybe even some tandem bike riding :)  While there, we'll check out Minnehaha Falls, which is a pretty legit waterfall just 15 minutes from the U.  Sign up [here](https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dEUwSWk3NzFiNTlEaFExeng5N09QaWc6MQ)!  Don't miss out on a fun time with us!
