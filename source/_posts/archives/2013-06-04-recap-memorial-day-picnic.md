It was a fun, relaxing Memorial Day picnic. People brought their own desserts and other main course items. Whoever made the horchata...great job!!! Some people went fishing, others just hung out, and some of us played over-the-hill soccer (there was actually a small hill that spanned across the middle of the field) with some people who were over-the-hill in age only.

:P

Can someone figure out if Theo is doing some kind of rain dance or is he trying to kick the soccer ball?
