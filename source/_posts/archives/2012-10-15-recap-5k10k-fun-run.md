title: 'RECAP: 5K/10K Fun Run'

---

The weather was freezing and we saw a few specks of snow, but we had a great time running, walking and cheering each other on along the Mississippi and across the Stone Arch Bridge two weeks ago!   Afterwards we had some nice hot chocolate, chili and barbecue.  In total we raised about $800 that will go towards air fare for the Winter Institute in California in January.  Here are some of the photos from the run; to view the rest, see the [flickr page] (http://www.flickr.com/photos/gpminneapolis/sets/72157631727116111/).
