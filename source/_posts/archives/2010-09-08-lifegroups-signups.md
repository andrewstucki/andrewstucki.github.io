What's a LIFE group?  It’s a small gathering of people where we **L**isten to one another, **I**ntercede for each other (i.e., pray), **F**ellowship, and **E**ngage God together.  It’s an opportunity to talk about life, God, and the things that happened during the week with a small group of people, with whom you can develop close long-lasting friendships.  Sign up below!
