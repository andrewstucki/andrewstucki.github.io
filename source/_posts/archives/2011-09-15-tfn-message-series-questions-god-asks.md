Where did the summer go? Although its not time to bust out the winter jackets yet, it might be time to check where they are, because its definitely getting cooler!

We will be continuing our message series on the "Questions God Asks." This week, we will be looking into the question "Where are you?" Where will you be this Friday night? Hopefully joining us at 7PM in Coffman 303 for bible study! As usual we will be starting with dinner, and have a fun and exciting post-TFN activity!
