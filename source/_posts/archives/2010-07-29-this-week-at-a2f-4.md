To add a little excitement to the summer, we're changing Bible study locations again!  For this week only, TFN will be at **324 Coffman**, incidentally the room we got the last time we had a detour.  If you will notice, however, I tried to use a different detour sign this week.

Also, Pastor Timothy will be starting an exciting new message series!  After Bible study, we will head over to his place for some dessert and games.  Hope to see you there!
