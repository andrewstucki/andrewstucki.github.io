title: 'We''re back!'

This Friday we're back on campus at Coffman, although in a new location, Room 324.  We'll start at the same time, 7pm with dinner, and after our Bible study, we'll continue with our "Multiply Your Talents" courses!  Last week in the cooking class I learned how to clean, chop, and arrange fruit platters.  Don't worry, Photoshop and Video Editing people, maybe you can take cooking in the next session :)
