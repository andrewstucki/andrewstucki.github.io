title: 'This Friday: Minigolf, Go Karts, and Bumper Boats...OH MY!'

---

Hi everyone! We will be back on campus this Friday for TFN Bible Study. Back to the usual place (Coffman 303), usual time (7PM) and with the usual home-cooked dinner to start off the night!

Afterwards, we will be heading over to Lilliputt for a fun night of golf, go karts, and bumper boats. And I can't think of a better way to cool off from the hot summer sun than a round of bumper boats! Be sure to bring some extra cash for our activity, and we'll see you there!
