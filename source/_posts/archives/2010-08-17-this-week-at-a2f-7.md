Hey guys, hope you are making the most of the last days of summer!  Don't be bummed that school is starting soon, though.  We'll be kicking off the semester with tons of fun activities during welcome week, leading up to our New Student Welcome Night!

This week, our Bible study will be at the same time and place, 6:30 pm, 3030 Coffman.  Afterwards, weather permitting, we're going to head over to Lilli Putt for some mini-golf action.  Some of the guys went to check it out last week and reported the presence of many sand traps and water hazards, so be sure to watch out for those :)
