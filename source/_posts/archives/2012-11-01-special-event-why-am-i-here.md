title: 'SPECIAL EVENT: Why Am I Here?'

---

Hey everyone! This Friday, we will be having a very special TFN Bible Study. We will be having a special talk called "Why Am I Here?," where we will be talking about life purpose. It is definitely something that relates to all of us, so I hope you and your friends can join us!

We will be meeting this Friday at 7PM at the President's Room in Coffman, and as usual, we will have a delicious dinner for everyone who can make it. Hope to see you there!
