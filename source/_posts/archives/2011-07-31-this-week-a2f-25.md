Wow, I can't believe it's August already!  The state fair's just around the corner, and then it's another new fall semester!  An unannounced change - we'll be meeting on WEDNESDAY this week, and this time Josiah will really be giving the Bible study :)  Please note the day change, and we'll see you there!
