title: 'TFN this Friday!'

---

Hey everyone! Hope you are all having a great week! Just wanted to send out a friendly reminder that we will be having our TFN Bible Study as usual at Coffman 303 @ 7PM. We will be continuing our message series "Questions God Asks" with the question "What is your name?"

So come join us this Friday for dinner, bible study, and as always, a fun post-TFN activity! What will it be this week? We'll keep that under wraps for now, but we will tell you that it will be a lot of fun! Don't believe me? Check out our pictures from last Friday!
