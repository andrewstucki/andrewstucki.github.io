For those of you who live out in Bailey and missed our awesome Winter Welcome Night last week, we have something just for you tonight!  Join us for the a2f Open House, 6:30 pm at the North Star Ballroom in the St. Paul Student Center.  Like last week, we'll end with a free Korean BBQ dinner, so come hungry and bring your friends!
