We're back on campus after a whirlwind trip to Chicago!  Pictures are up and I'll post a recap soon.  Hope you can make it out to Coffman tonight and hear Josiah share with us from God's word.  Afterwards, we'll have a farewell for our bro Sam, who's moving on to join our Austin, TX fellowship next week :(  We'll miss you, Sam!
