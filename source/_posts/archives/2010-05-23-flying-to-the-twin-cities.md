title: 'Flying to the Twin Cities!'

In only a couple of weeks, we will be boarding a plane heading to Minnesota to launch acts2fellowship Minnesota! Our first-ever Bible study will be on June 11th, 6:30 pm, right on campus at Coffman Memorial Union. We can’t believe how quickly our departure date is approaching, but we are super excited to settle in and meet everyone! Since we hail from sunny California, it might take us some time to adjust to not surfing and eating tofu salad (just kidding), but we look forward to calling Minnesota “home”. See you soon!
