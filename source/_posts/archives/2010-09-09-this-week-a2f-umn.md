Hope everyone enjoyed the New Student Welcome Night!  I'm sure you all enjoyed the free Korean BBQ!  But was that YOUR favorite part?  Mine was the hilarious skit.  Comment away!

**Today** we are having **The Friday Night Bible Study @ 6:30pm in Keller Hall (EECS Bldg), Room 3-115**.  Then, we'll head over to **Strikes, Spares, and Scoops** (Bowling + Ice Cream) @ 8pm at Goldy's Game Room (Coffman basement).  Join us for both events!
