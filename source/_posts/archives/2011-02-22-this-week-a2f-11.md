Sorry for the ambiguity last week, but Bible study will stay on FRIDAY this week, same time and location.  Join us for another exciting installment of "Finding Faith Through Film."  We'll be watching clips from Lord of the Rings and talking about the topic of "War and Peace."  Afterwards, we'll head over to the Rec for some sports fellowship!
