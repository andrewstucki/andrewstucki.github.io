title: 'Winter Retreat Starts on Campus'

---

Hi everyone! Welcome back from winter break! Hope everyone's first few days of school is going well, and are all getting back in the swing of things. 

It is hard to believe, but Winter Retreat is just around the corner! This weekend, we will be heading up to Covenant Pines for what is sure to be a very fun and enriching weekend together. But before that, we will be starting off our Winter Retreat actually on campus. The first message of the retreat will be this Friday at the Mississippi Room so that those who may not be able to make it can still join us for bible study. Be sure to note the early start time! We will be meeting at 6:30 starting with dinner. See you guys then!
