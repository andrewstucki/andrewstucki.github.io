title: 'TFN @ President''s Room'

---

We are halfway through finals week, so it is time for us to half-celebrate! Hope you guys can all finish the year strong before heading into the summer. For those of you who will still be around this Friday, we will still be having our TFN bible study on campus in the President's Room (Coffman 3rd floor). However, instead of having dinner at the President's Room, we will be going out for dinner by LIFE Groups. So if you would like to join us for that, be sure to contact one of the staff or leave a comment here.

After our bible study, we will have a hang out time at D House with everyone who is done with finals or who don't want to study (although we strongly recommend you do :) ). So for those who will still be around this Friday, we will see you there! And if you are going home for the summer, we all want to wish you a fun and safe summer! We will see you guys soon!
