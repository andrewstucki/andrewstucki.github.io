We'll be trying something new this week for Bible study!  On Friday, the guys and girls will meet separately.  The girls will gather at our usual time and location, 7pm in Coffman 303, and listen to some stories and sharing about "girl-related" issues.  I'm not sure exactly what that means, but I'm told it'll be a very fun and special time, with delicious food and crafts at the end.  The guys will be meeting at Pastor Timothy's house at 7pm and discuss manly subjects, like climbing mountains or hunting wildlife with your bare hands--just kidding.  We'll wrap up with some intense, competitive games, and maybe a manly movie, although somehow I think my [personal favorite manly movie](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060665/) will not be picked for the occasion.  Please contact a staff member if you need a ride!
