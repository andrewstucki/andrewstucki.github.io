title: 'Summer Run Training Tuesdays/Thursdays'

---

Fellowship, sweat, pain, endorphin rush...what do all of these have to do with one another?  They're all experienced together every Tuesdays and Thursdays, 6pm, at the East River Flats Park, located below Yudolf.  Some of us are training for 5K/10K/Half Marathon, some of us (such as the author of this post) are trying to jumpstart the good habit of running for the umpteenth time, and some of us actually don't like running but just wanted to hang out together.  It doesn't matter what group you fall in so feel free to join us!!!
