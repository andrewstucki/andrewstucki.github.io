Why is this man smiling?  He just picked up some new talents from MYT...

Any number multiplied by zero is zero but not in the world of MYT (Multiply Your Talent).  After several weeks of instruction, MYT has defied mathematical conventions by multiplying the talents of those who had little to no experience in their respective classes.  Here are some pretty amazing things that were produced:

-The cooking class cooked up sumptuous, mouth-watering mini-meals which were happily consumed after each MYT session.  

-The video editing class produced a video for this Saturday's Paint-A-Thon.  

-The Photoshop class designed flyers for our upcoming New Student Welcome Night.

-The photography class has already graduated one photographer who was ready to cover this past Saturday's Worldview Camp.  All of the pictures in this gallery have been taken by members of the class.

-The praise band class performed a medley of songs in front of a live-audience.

-The Java programming class created a computer version of the much beloved boardgame, Battleship.
