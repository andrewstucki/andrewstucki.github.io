As announced, our Old Testament Survey class starts tomorrow, taught by our very own Pastor Timothy!  We'll be starting at 8 pm at the STSS building, room 121.  The course material fee is $12, but it'll be well worth the time and money.`*`  Hope to see you there!

`*`Giant scroll not included. See class for details.
