title: 'Bible Study Back on Friday'

---

The past weekend was full of excitement with the Fall Getaway and Gracepoint's Baptism Service, and this coming week is no different!  We'll meet for Bible Study on the third floor of Coffman, starting with dinner together at 7pm as usual.  Afterwards, we'll be hanging out and making preparations for our staff Mia and Ray's wedding this weekend.  See you Friday!
