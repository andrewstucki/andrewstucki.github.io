Hi Everyone! Great news! By the end of today, your school-week will be 33% done! Hope everyone is hanging in there before the Thanksgiving break. Just wanted to also let you guys know that this week's bible study will be on Tuesday night due to the holidays. Be sure to let your friends know and spread the word around so that they don't miss out! Thanks!
