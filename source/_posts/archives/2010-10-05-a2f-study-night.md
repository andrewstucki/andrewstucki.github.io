title: 'a2f Study Night!'

As announced at last week's TFN, we'll be having weekly study sessions at the Yudof lounge, from 7-10 pm.  This week, it will be on Tuesday (TODAY), but going forward, we'll be studying together on Wednesday nights.  Just drop in whenever you can and do your reading or problem sets with us.  Yummy snacks provided!
