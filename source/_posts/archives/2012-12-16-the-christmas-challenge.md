title: 'The Christmas Challenge'

---

Pastor Timothy shared the Christmas Challenge in the message this past Sunday, calling us to share the Gospel with someone during winter break. We know that it is not an easy task, but we hope that as you pray and think about the best way to present and share the gospel to them, you can experience Godâ€™s heart for them and you will gain the courage to share the gospel with others throughout the year.

Please feel free to share what you are learning from taking up the Christmas Challenge as a way to encourage and inspire others to share the gospel.
