This coming Friday, we have a very special TFN bible study with a very special guest speaker. Pastor Ed Kang and his wife Kelly will be visiting, and he will be bringing us the message for this week! For many of the staff, we have known Pastor Ed and Kelly for many years. They have been our spiritual leaders, and continue to lead us and pray for us as we are out here in Minnesota. California is about 2,000 miles away, so you definitely don't want to miss this chance to hear from him as he brings us the message. And as always, we will be kicking off our bible study with a delicious dinner, so be sure to come hungry!
