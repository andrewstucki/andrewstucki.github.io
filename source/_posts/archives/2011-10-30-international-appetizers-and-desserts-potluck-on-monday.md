Tired of your dorm food? Want to taste different kinds of food and cuisines at one time? Want to flex your culinary muscles?Â Well then a2f's "International Appetizers and Desserts" potluck is for you! We will be enjoying some delicious food on Monday (Oct 31) at 7PM at the D House, and hope that all of you can join us.

If you don't have time to cook or bring anything, no worries! You are still welcome to join us and enjoy a fun time of food and fellowship! After dinner, we will be hanging out together, and for those who need to hit the books, we will have study hall as well! If you would like to come, please drop a comment, or contact one of the staff, and we will be sure to give you a ride. Hope to see you all there!
