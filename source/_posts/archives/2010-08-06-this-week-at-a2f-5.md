Hi guys, we're back to our regular time and location today, 6:30 pm at 303 Coffman.  We're going to continue our study of Genesis 2, so our Bible study will feature a talking snake and magical fruits.  If you've always wondered what this interesting story is all about, come with your curiosity and questions tonight!

Afterwards, we'll be heading outside to enjoy the beautiful weather and play some ultimate frisbee!
