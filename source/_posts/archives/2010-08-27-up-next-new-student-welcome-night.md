Hi guys, I can't believe August is almost over, and you know what that means--it's almost time for our **NEW STUDENT WELCOME NIGHT**!  We're going to have an action-packed [Welcome Week](http://www.acts2fellowship.org/minnesota/nswn/welcomeweek/), with tons of awesome activities, leading up to the main event.  Definitely mark your calendars for [NSWN on Wednesday, September 8](http://www.acts2fellowship.org/minnesota/nswn), but until then, check out this teaser trailer and our NSWN website: (http://www.acts2fellowship.org/minnesota/nswn/).

It’s a night filled with rockin' live music, fun videos, an awesome skit, and a thought-provoking talk.  But wait, there's more!  We're also serving up some **FREE **food (**KOREAN BBQ!!!**) and exciting games and prizes!  NSWN only happens **ONCE **a year, so don't miss out!
