This Friday, we will have our TFN at the usual time, but instead of the usual room 303, we will be moving across the hall to the Mississippi Room! Why? For our annual Christmas Gift Exchange! Join in the spirit of giving and receiving as we share a night filled with fun games and gifts!

If you can, please bring a NEW &amp; WRAPPED gift within the price range of $5-$10 with you on Friday, that will be greatly appreciated. The more gifts we have, the more fun it will be! Here are some pictures from last year's gift exchange!
