title: 'Update - TFN at Pastor Timothy''s'

---

Looks like we'll be off-campus another week.  We just found out Coffman will be closed Friday night, so we'll be meeting at Pastor Timothy's house instead.

We'll kick off the night at 7pm as usual with dinner, followed by Bible study, and then we'll have the first session of our "Multiply Your Talents" (MYT) courses!  Just a reminder, we're offering Video Filming/Editing, Photoshop, and Food Management, and it's not too late to sign up!
