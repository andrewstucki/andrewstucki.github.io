title: 'RECAP: Fall Getaway 2012'

---

What a weekend! We got away  for a couple days and spent some time enjoying hikes, sports, board games, and of course, delicious food! There were also chances to quiet down while taking in the beautiful outdoors, discussing the devotional passage, and warming up around the campfire. We were all a little bummed to come back, but it's called a "get-away" for a reason! Hope to see you around this week!

These are just a few of the shots from the weekend! To view the rest, head to [http://www.flickr.com/photos/gpminneapolis/sets/72157631837150912/with/8116590600/](http://www.flickr.com/photos/gpminneapolis/sets/72157631837150912/with/8116590600/)
