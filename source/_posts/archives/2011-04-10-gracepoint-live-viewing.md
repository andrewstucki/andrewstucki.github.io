title: 'Gracepoint Live Viewing!'

---

This Saturday at 1pm in Keller Hall Room 3210, we'll be getting together to watch Gracepoint Live, a huge theatrical production put on by our sister fellowships and church in Berkeley, California.  It's so big we can only afford to make it happen once every two years, so you don't want to miss it!  Check out the trailer and website.
