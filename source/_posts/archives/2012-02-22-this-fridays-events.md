"More Than A Face" is a special talk for all girls, and it talks about media's portrayal of women, and its effect on their self-esteem. It is a really good talk, and this will be a good chance to invite your friends to hear what the bible has to say on this topic. It will be at the President's Room this Friday at 7PM.

**FOR THE BROTHERS**

Don't worry guys, we didn't forget about you! We will be kicking it at the D House for a delicious BBQ followed by our usual TFN bible study. As usual, it will be at 7PM, so if you need a ride to D House, be sure to contact one of the staff or leave a message here. See you guys there!
