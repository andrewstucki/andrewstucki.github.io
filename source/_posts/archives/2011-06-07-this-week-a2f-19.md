title: 'This Week @ a2f'

---

We'll be moving rooms again, this week to 325 Coffman, but don't worry, we'll be here a while . . . I think.  Anyways, same time, same Bible, and this week, we'll be hearing from brother Ray Wong about how God's worked in his life.  Afterwards, we'll continue on in our "Multiply Your Talents" courses, and if you weren't here last week to try the meatballs that we made in cooking class, you missed out!  Live without regrets this week and show up for The Friday Night!
