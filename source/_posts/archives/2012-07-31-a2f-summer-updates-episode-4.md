title: 'A2F Summer Updates: Episode 4'

---

Glacier potholes, camping at lake superior, 10 mile hikes, go karts, and bumper boats. Just your average two weeks at A2F! We had a brother's camping trip, a sister's outing to Taylor Falls, and for our post-TFN activity last Friday, we had some very memorable times at Lilliputt. Summer is almost coming to an end, and we are definitely making the most of it. Only one more month!
