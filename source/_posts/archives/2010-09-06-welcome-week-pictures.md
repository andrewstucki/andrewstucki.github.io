As promised, here are some pictures from what's been going on:

On Thursday, we relaxed after dinner over some bubbling Italian soda and board games.

I set up this ill-fated tower that I destroyed moments later in Jenga.

The next day, we kicked off our Friday night Bible study with some pizza and a rousing game of Egg, Chicken, and Dinosaur.

No, it's not a recipe for some exotic, Jurassic-period dish.  It does involve a handful of luck and a dash of silliness, though!  After that, Pastor Timothy gave the Bible study based on John 1, Jesus' invitation to his disciples to come and see what a relationship with him is all about.

Then, we headed outside for some Ultimate Frisbee.  The sports continued on Saturday at the East River Flats, where we had two big games of ultimate and a game of flag football going on at the same time.

If you couldn't make it out to any of these, don't worry--the best is yet to come.  We've still got our Labor Day picnic at East River Flats, followed by Games and Sports at the Armory Gym (Tuesday, 8pm), and finally, New Student Welcome Night!
