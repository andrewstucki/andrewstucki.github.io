If you can join us, we will be meeting every **Tuesday and Thursday at 6:30PM on East River Parkway** in front of Pioneer Hall to run/walk. This is for all of those who would like to get some exercise, get healthy, fellowship and have fun, or train for the **Minnesota Half Marathon or 5K on August 4**! Many of us are already signed up for both the 5K or Half Marathon, and if you would like to join us, you can **[sign up here](http://www.minnesotahalfmarathon.com/)**.
