Kick off your Spring Break right with our Spring Getaway! We will be trekking out to Northeast Iowa for a weekend of food, fellowship, games, and just CHILLIN'. We will be leaving Friday during the daytime, and coming back on Sunday afternoon. For 3 days and 2 nights, the cost is a very awesome $45. If you want to join us and haven't signed up yet, you can [sign up here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dFo2V2RKeEZSa1ZRajVSdjQ2YXhXZWc6MQ#gid=0).

Have a great week!
