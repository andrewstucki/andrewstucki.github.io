title: 'SIGN-UPS: The Passion Experience'

---

We will be bringing back the Passion Experience this year in preparation for Good Friday and Easter Sunday. The Passion Experience is an immersive display where you will actually get to see what Jesus went through in the days leading up to his crucifixion. It is a very powerful display, and for those who were there last year, we will be having additional displays that we'll be showing for the first time here!

You can [sign up here](http://www.wejoinin.com/sheets/kosin)!
