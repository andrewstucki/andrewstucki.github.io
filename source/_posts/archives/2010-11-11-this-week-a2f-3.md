This week, we'll be meeting at our usual time, Friday 7 pm, but in a different room, **325 Coffman**.  Afterwards, we'll be practicing some fun song and dance routines for our special Thanksgiving Celebration after church this Sunday!  Come join us for another Friday evening of fellowship, studying God's word, and having a lot of laughs along the way.
