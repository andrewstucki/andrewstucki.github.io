---

Are you jones-ing for some basketball? Want to play with your friends as well as make new ones? Well look no further!

Calling all guys! We have a 3-on-3 basketball tournament on Thursday, 7PM at the Rec Center North Gym. Our goal: Have fun, hang out, and meet new people. Oh yeah, and win some small prizes as well :)

So you can come with your team all set, or you can just come and we'll plug you into a team. Either way, it is going to be a blast so hope to see you there!
