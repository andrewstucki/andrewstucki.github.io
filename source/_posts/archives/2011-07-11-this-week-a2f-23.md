title: 'This Week @ a2f'

---

Hey a2f!  The staff are back from the training retreat in California, and man was it a packed week!  It felt like college all over again, except I wanted to go to all the classes, and even stayed awake :)

This week, we'll be meeting back on campus for our Bible study at our usual time and location, 7pm at 325 Coffman.  Afterwards, we'll have a special "surprise" activity; stay tuned!
