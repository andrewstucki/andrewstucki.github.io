Welcome back from spring break!  This week, we're back to our same time and location for our Bible study, Friday night 7pm at Coffman 303.  We'll be starting a new series covering the Gospel of Mark, titled "The ReMARKable Jesus."  Get it?  Yeah, I'm not a big fan of puns so I can't take credit for this one.  But Mark is a fast-paced, action-packed book, so punny or not, you won't want to miss this!
