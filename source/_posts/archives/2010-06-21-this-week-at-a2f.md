We'll be having our usual The Friday Night ("TFN") Bible study, same time, same location.  As always, we'll start with a delicious dinner.  Hope this picture of last week's meal will entice you to come!  Note how happy everyone looks--except for my friend John Vang (second from right).  Don't be alarmed, though.  He always looks that tough when he's having a good time.

After Bible study, we will be doing some super secret mystery activity!  Well, it's so secret we don't even know what it's going to be yet, especially since the weather is so unpredictable.  But as soon as we figure it out, it will be posted here, so please check back often!
