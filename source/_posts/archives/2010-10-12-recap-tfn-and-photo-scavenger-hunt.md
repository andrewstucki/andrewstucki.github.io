Last week at TFN, we had a guest speaker, Pastor Ed Kang, and his wife, Kelly, come visit us and give the bible study. He spoke on John 4 and the encounter Jesus has with a Samaritan woman. Pastor Ed highlighted how Jesus uses a simple conversation regarding thirst and a cup of water to bring up the unmet spiritual need this woman, and all of us have, and how we all look to satisfy it through inadequate means.

After a time of reflection about how this message applied to us and a time of mingling, we started our post-TFN activity for the night: Fotos of Live Action Scavenger Hunt (otherwise know as F.L.A.S.H.™) We were split up into teams and told to take photos satisfying certain "themes" or "topics." Take a look at the highlights and vote your favorites in the comments!:
