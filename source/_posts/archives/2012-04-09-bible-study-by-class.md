title: 'Bible Study by Class'

---

Hello a2f world! We had a packed few days this past weekend as we wrapped up Passion Week with the Passion Experience, [Good Friday Service](http://www.flickr.com/photos/gpminneapolis/sets/72157629781979901/), and [Easter Service](http://www.flickr.com/photos/gpminneapolis/sets/72157629781985561/). So while you can look back at some of the pictures for this past weekend, I will bring you guys the plans for this coming week!

This Friday, we will be having bible study by class. Not too long ago, we had class bible studies and it was a lot of fun! If you need a refresher, or want to get a sneak peek at just what goes down during these smaller group bible studies, here are some pictures to help.

What is in store for this Friday? There is only one way to find out! Join us this Friday and get in on all of the fun and excitement! We will be meeting at various homes instead of our usual spot at Â Coffman, so if you need more information or a ride, be sure to contact one of the staff. Have a great week, and see you Friday!
