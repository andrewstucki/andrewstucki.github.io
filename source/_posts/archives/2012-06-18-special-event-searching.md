title: 'Special Event: "Searching"'

---

This Friday, we have a very special event called "Searching" where we will shed light on a topic that I am sure is on the minds of all college students here at the U. With summer school now in full swing, take some time out this Friday to join us for a night starting with delicious burgers and hot dogs fresh off the grill, a special talk, and capped with Glow-in-the-dark Ultimate Frisbee!

If you are a fan of food, fellowship, fun, or any combination of the three, this is the event for you. We will be meeting at Coffman 303 at 7PM this Friday, so be sure to spread the word and come and join us!
