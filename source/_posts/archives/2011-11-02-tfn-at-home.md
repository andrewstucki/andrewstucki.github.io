This Friday, we will be doing something new by having our TFN Bible Study at D-House @ 7pm, starting with the usual dinner. Afterwards, we'll begin practicing for our Thanksgiving Celebration. What is Thanksgiving Celebration you may ask? Check our these [pictures](http://www.flickr.com/photos/gpminneapolis/sets/72157625404127398/) from last year!

Rides will be provided from the dorms at 630pm. If you need a ride or live off campus and need a pickup, please leave a comment on our website, contact one of the staff, or text 512-222-8723 (512-2ACTS2F) your name and location. Thanks! See you all this friday at D House!
