title: 'New Student Welcome Night!'

---

It's back, the biggest welcome event of the year!  If you are new to campus, or couldn't make it out last year, be sure to catch New Student Welcome Night at the U this year.  And new for 2011, we have three separate showings:  Wednesday 9/7 at Coffman Theater at 3 pm and 6 pm, and Thursday 9/9 at the North Star Ballroom at 5pm.  So NSWN is back with all the free BBQ dinner, skits, music, special talk, fun games, and awesome prizes--times three!  See you there!
