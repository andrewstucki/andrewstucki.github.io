Last week, we celebrated Pastor Timothy's 40th birthday!  We surprised him at John and Eunice's apartment with a potluck feast.  Everyone contributed their specialty dish, including a huge roast, hand-crafted egg rolls, pumpkin croquettes, beef stew, and more!

After dinner, a lot of us sang a specially-prepared medley of classic praise songs based on Philippians, since we were all so encouraged as we did devotions through that text recently.

The beautiful medley ended, unfortunately, in a rap featuring Sam and Sean, who sang their hearts out and earned an "A" for effort.

You can tell by my reaction and Chi's expression in the background that the "special music" was very special indeed.  Apparently, I'm slated on some secret rotation to rap in the next birthday with Jon Fu, but this first performance may end up being the last.

After the unforgettable singing, we presented Pastor Timothy with a cake and some gifts to express our gratitude and appreciation for his love and service to our church.

The Gracepoint Minneapolis team got him a new free-standing basketball hoop and some new shoes, and our friends in Gracepoint Davis sent a new set of fishing gear, since he had to leave most of his fishing equipment behind when he moved here.

Gracepoint Davis also sent a video that they made for Pastor Timothy, the theme of which was "even though you are 40 . . . ."  I'm not sure if that was as encouraging as it was intended to be :)  But it was very heart-warming to see everyone's faces, and we felt like we were back in California again.

We finally finished celebrating just a few days ago, when we installed the basketball hoop on Pastor Timothy's driveway.  He took the inaugural free-throw shot, which he swished with his trusty Bosten Celtics basketball.  Sean and I played the inaugural 1-on-1 game, but he requested that no pictures be posted about that event, so you'll just have to imagine what the outcome was for yourself.

But I digress.  Happy 40th birthday, Pastor Timothy!  Thank you for giving to the Lord!
