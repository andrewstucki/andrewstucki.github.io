Pictures are up from winter retreat!  Check them out on the right.  My personal favorites are from the snow ball fight, #9334 followed by #9335.  Any ideas for a good caption?

This week, we'll be continuing our TFN Bible study series through the movie "Cars" and talk about the theme of success and worth.  Afterwards, we'll head over to the Rec for another round of dodge ball!  Please be sure to come out and support your teams!
