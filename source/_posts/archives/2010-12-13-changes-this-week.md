title: 'Changes this week'

---

This is just a friendly reminder that there will be no Life Cafe this week due to finals. We will resume at the start of next semester at the same time and same place. Be sure to stay tuned for more information!

Instead, we'll be having study hall this week on Tuesday and Wednesday evening at Pastor Timothy and Alice's home for all of those who need a nice, cozy place to study. There will be some tutors (aka the staff) if you need it, and as always, good snacks! If you would like to come over, be sure to contact any of the staff, and we will be able to give you rides to and from their place. 

Good luck with finals and stay warm!
