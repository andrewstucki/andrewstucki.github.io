Join acts2fellowship this week as we examine the topic of whether intelligent people have reasons to believe in God in an age of science.  We will have two (identical) lectures this week, one on Wednesday at 6pm in the Mississippi Room (Coffman 3rd floor), and one on Thursday at 7pm in the Cherrywood Room (SPSC).  Come with your thinking caps and an open mind!
