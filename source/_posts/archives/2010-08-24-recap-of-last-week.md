title: 'Recap of last week'

---

If you couldn't make it out to TFN last week, we'll try to catch you up on what happened.  More after the jump!

We covered Genesis 3, the fall of man, the significance of the Forbidden Fruit (not necessarily an apple), and the Bible's definition of "sin" as the "I" problem.  Afterwards, we went out to Lilli Put where we played mini-golf, bumper boats, and go-karts.

Props to Annemie for getting a hole-in-one--twice!  The guys on the other hand, didn't fare so well on the greens.  Nathan felt so defeated he turned his back on the whole enterprise.

Let's just say most of us were glad we stopped counting after six strokes.  Afterwards, we headed over to the bumper boats, where we discovered "water hazards" of a different sort.

Finally, we rounded out the night at the go-kart race track!

It was a tightly contested race, with yours truly taking the lead for most of the laps.  Watch this video, however, to see who did NOT take the checkered flag.  Thanks, Hannah, for the quick video-editing work!
