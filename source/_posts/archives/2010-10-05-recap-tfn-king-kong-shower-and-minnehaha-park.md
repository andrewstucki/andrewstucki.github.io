title: 'RECAP: TFN, King Kong Shower, and Minnehaha Park'

---

We had another packed Friday and Saturday at a2f,  featuring fellowship, flag football, falls, and . . . King Kong.  Yeah, I couldn't figure out how to make that last one alliterate.  Read more after the jump!

Last week, we had an almost full house for The Friday Night Bible Study at 303 Coffman.  We concluded our "Why Am I" message series by considering the question, "Why am I so lonely?"

Caroline shared her story of how she experienced loneliness in college and found that only God could meet her deepest needs.  Then, Pastor Timothy talked about how loneliness is an American epidemic, and how the Bible says we are all relational beings created to connect with God and others.

Afterwards, we mingled a bit, then settled into a fierce game of King Kong Shower with four teams.  Unfortunately, no one can be told what King Kong Shower is--you have to experience it for yourself.

Pastor Timothy almost made it to the final four, but alas he fell while trying to execute my trademarked "engineer" move.

We closed out the night by celebrating our October birthdays with a big flaming cake!

The next day was a cool and sunny--perfect for a day at the park surrounded by the fall foliage!

We kicked things off with some gilled burgers, dogs, and hot soup!  Big thanks to our master grillers, Ray and Sam!

After we were all warm and full, the guys took to the field for some flag football.

It was a lot of fun, and even I enjoyed it.  Let's just say the game often moved me . . . into the ground.

The girls also had a blast throwing around the frisbee.

After sports, we went on a stroll to Minnehaha Falls.

We had a good time, really, even though no one is smiling in the guys' picture.

We ended the afternoon with a big game of Braveheart, which is like dodgeball.  But with really big yoga balls.  And, in this case, trees.

I was moved again . . . to the ground.

If you couldn't make it the time, don't worry!  We'll be having plenty of other fun outings at a2f, so stay tuned!
