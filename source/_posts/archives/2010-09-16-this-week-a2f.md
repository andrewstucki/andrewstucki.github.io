TONIGHT, we're having our usual The Friday Night Bible Study at 325 Coffman.  Please join us for a night of food, fellowship, and fun as we study God's word as a relevant and insightful guide to life.  Afterwards, we'll be heading over to the Stone Arch Bridge and Guthrie Theater for a night out on the town!

Now that school is in full swing, a2f is also kicking into gear with our first message series of the semester, entitled "Why Am I . . . ?"

Don't go through your college life just "going with the flow" without knowing why you do what you do.  Come join us as we look into the word of God for some answers!
