title: 'TFN on Thursday'

---

Can't wait till the end of the week? While we can't make Friday come any sooner, we can have our bible study come sooner! Since many of us will be taking off for our [Memorial Day Getaway](http://www.acts2fellowship.org/minnesota/2012/05/sign-up-memorial-day-getaway/)Â on Friday, bible study will be on Thursday this week in Coffman 303 at 7PM. We will be starting the night with dinner, as well as resuming our New Testament Survey. See you there!
