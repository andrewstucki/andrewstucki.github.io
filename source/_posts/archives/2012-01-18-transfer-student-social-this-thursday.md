We will be kicking off our week of events with a Transfer Student Social this Thursday! If you are a new transfer (or transfered in the fall), or you know someone who is a transfer student, drop on by the President's Room anytime between 11AM-1PM for some free pizza! It will be a great chance to meet other transfer students, hang out with a2f, and learn more about our group! Hope to see you there!
