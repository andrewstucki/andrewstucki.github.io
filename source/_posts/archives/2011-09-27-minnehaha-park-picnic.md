title: 'Minnehaha Park Picnic'

---

Wow! What a weekend! For our first outing of the new school year, we went to Minnehaha Park, and it was a fun-filled day of delicious BBQ, sports (including Braveheart, of course), and a short stroll down to the Minnehaha waterfall. Check out some of the pictures below, and for those who couldn't make it, hopefully you can join us for our next outing coming soon!
