title: 'CONNECT with Pastor Timothy and Alice on Thursday'

---

![This Thursday from 3:30-6PM](http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7191/6786952342_9755a74e68_b.jpg)

CONNECT is a great way to get to know Pastor Timothy and Alice outside of our bible studies and Sunday services. You can come with some questions you may have, just get to know each other, or even just shoot the breeze! They will be available each week to meet you. You can meet one-on-one, having a meeting with both of them, or even meet together with your friends! This week, they will be at **the Cube** inside Coffman (by Starbucks) on **Thursday**. If you would like to hang out or come with questions, [sign up here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dEFlSkdfM1cyNmYxWEFFNE05d3QyV3c6MQ#gid=0).

And if you can't make it on one of the time slots, feel free to fill out the form anyways, and they can work something out that will best fit your schedule.
