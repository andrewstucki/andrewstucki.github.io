That's right! Due to the Thanksgiving Retreat, and many of our friends leaving for California this Thursday and Friday, we will be moving our TFN Bible Study to Wednesday at the President's Room. There have been a lot of date and room changes these past few weeks, but thanks for hanging in there! Hope to see you on Wednesday as we continue our "Follow Me" series as well as continue practicing for our Thanksgiving Celebration!
