This Friday, we will be heading on up to Covenant Pines for our annual Winter Retreat! We will be taking off from Minneapolis around 5:30PM on Friday. Because of that, we wont be having our usual campus bible study this week. We will resume the following Friday back on campus for our Winter Kickoff! Stay tuned for more updates about that and the other events we will be having next week!
