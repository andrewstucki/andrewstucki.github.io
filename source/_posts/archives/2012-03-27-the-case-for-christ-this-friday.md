title: 'The Case for Christ this Friday'

---

This Friday, we will be having a special talk called The Case for Christ. It will be in the Mississippi Room (3rd Floor of Coffman) at 7PM this Friday. So what is The Case of Christ exactly? It will be a presentation of the historical evidence for the person of Jesus and the life he lived, the claims he made about himself, and his resurrection. In the spirit of Easter coming up in a couple of weeks, this is a great chance to learn more about the Christian faith! We hope you can make it, and be sure to invite your friends who may be interested in this talk! If the talk isn't riveting enough already, we will be starting the night with a delicious free dinner so be sure to get here on time!
