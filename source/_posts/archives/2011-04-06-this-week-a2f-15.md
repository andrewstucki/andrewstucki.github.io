This week, we'll be resuming our current message series, "The Remarkable Jesus."  Join us as we study Jesus' encounters with various people and what he reveals to them, and us, about God.  Afterwards, we'll be taking advantage of this beautiful weather and playing some ultimate frisbee!

And on Saturday, we've reserved the indoor gym at nearby [Luxton Park](http://www.minneapolisparks.org/default.asp?PageID=88&amp;parkid=291) from 3:30-5:30 pm for volleyball and basketball.  And if the field is free, we'll play some soccer as well!
