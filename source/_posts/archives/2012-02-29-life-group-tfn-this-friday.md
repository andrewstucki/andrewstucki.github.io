Hope you're ready for the weekend! This Friday, we will be having our LIFE Group TFN at various homes. This week, the entire Freshmen class will meet at D House, the Sophomores will meet at Rhee House, and the Upperclassmen will be at John/Eunice's Apartment. As usual, we will start with a delicious home-cooked meal, and have a fun post-TFN activity!

So you might be wondering, "what **exactly** is Life Group TFN?" Well, since a picture is worth 1000 words, here are a couple of pictures (equivalent of 4000 words).

Be sure to spread the word! If we work together, hopefully nobody will miss the memo and show up to the President's Room looking for us!
