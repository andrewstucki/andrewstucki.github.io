title: 'This Week @ a2f'

Most of the staff will be flying out this Friday for a retreat, but never fear, we will still have our Friday Night Bible Study - on Thursday! Â Swing by Coffman 325 at 7pm this Thursday to hear brother Chris teach us from the word of God and share how God has worked in his life!

Afterwards, we'll head down to Goldy's Game Room for "Bowl for a Buck"!\
