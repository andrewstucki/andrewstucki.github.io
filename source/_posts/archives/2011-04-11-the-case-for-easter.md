This Friday (4/15), acts2fellowship will be hosting a special talk, "The Case For Easter."  Central to the Christian faith is the controversial claim that Jesus of Nazareth died and rose again, proving himself to be the Son of God and the sole source of salvation and eternal life for all humanity.  We'll look at the historical evidence surrounding Jesus' death and examine various theories to see if the "resurrection hypothesis" is the best explanation of the established facts.  Whether you're a committed Christian or just curious about why Easter is a big deal, all are welcome to join us for this intellectually stimulating presentation.  Free dinner and refreshments served!
