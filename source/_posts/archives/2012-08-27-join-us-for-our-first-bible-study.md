title: 'Join Us for Our First Bible Study!'

---

Hi everyone! We will be having our first bible study of the new school year this Friday! Starting at 6:30PM, we will be at the Northrop Mall to hang out, play sports, and enjoy a delicious dinner together. After that, we will have our bible study at 8:30PM in Coffman 303.

Looking for a fellowship? This will be a great chance to dive into God's Word together, meet others who are in similar shoes as you are, and get your semester started on the right foot! Hope to see you there!
