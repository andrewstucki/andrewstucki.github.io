They said it couldn't be done. They said that we were crazy to attempt such a feat. Those were the voices coming from the runners themselves. Yet here we are, 5 days removed, and all are standing tall! We may not be walking properly, but we are all standing! Here are some pictures to remember the joys and pains.
