Just to keep you all on your toes (not really, we just couldn't reserve our room in Coffman), TFN will be at D-House this week! Remember the early start time of 6:30PM, so that means we will be providing rides at Coffman at 6PM. If you can't make it at 6 or need a ride from somewhere else, be sure to notify any of the staff, and we will work something out for you. Otherwise, we'll see you Friday!
