title: 'We''re here!'

---

Wow, it’s hard to believe we’ve been here for a full week already!  We were so thankful for our friends from our sister churches [Gracepoint Berkeley](http://www.gracepointonline.org), [Davis](http://gracepointdavis.org/), and [Austin](http://www.gracepointaustin.org) who flew out here to help us settle in.  We unloaded three 28’ trailers full of our stuff in less than seven hours, including the time we spent munching on delicious slices of Punch Pizza!  I’ll post a link to some pictures as soon as we get them uploaded.  In the mean while, check out this [video](http://www.vimeo.com/12553320") to see what we’ve been up to!

This past week we had our historic first “The Friday Night” (“TFN”) Bible study, and eight new friends joined us for a time of looking into God’s word and applying it to our lives.  Pastor Timothy brought a message from our Devotion Time text that week, Mark 15, and exhorted us to follow Christ’s example of saving others instead of saving ourselves.  Afterward, we headed down to the bowling alley in the Coffman Memorial Union and squeezing in a few frames before closing time.  Finally, we dropped in at [Pagoda](http://www.pagodadinkytown.com/) for some amazing Chinese food.  Thanks to Peiran for the recommendation; the fried fish was awesome!

We look forward to many more Friday nights of connecting with God and one another as we will continue to meet for TFN Bible studies throughout the summer.  Please join us for this week’s TFN, starting with a FREE dinner at 6:30 pm in 303 Coffman.  See you there!
