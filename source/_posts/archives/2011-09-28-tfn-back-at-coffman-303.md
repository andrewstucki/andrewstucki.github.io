Hello world! Hope you guys are having a great week! Just wanted to let you know that this Friday, we will be having our normal TFN back in Coffman 303. We'll be concluding our message series "Questions God Asks". This week, we'll look into the question God asks Jonah, "Should I not be concerned?" and see what this question reveals about God's character.

Afterwards, we will be having a very special Post-TFN activity for both the guys and the girls! For the girls, you will be hanging out together for a fun time of fellowship and bonding over some crafts! If it is anything like [last year's](http://www.flickr.com/photos/gpminneapolis/sets/72157626414489660/), it will be a blast!

For the guys, we will be heading over to Van Cleve indoor gym for some fun 3-on-3 basketball, so be sure to bring some sports clothes! I'm sure some of you may be thinking basketball isn't for everyone. Never fear! Its all about the fellowship, so basketball and non-basketball players unite and we are going to have a great time and share some memories together! Don't believe me? Check out the video below.
