title: 'RECAP: Brother''s Camping Trip'

---

10 miles to the top, and 10 miles conquered! This past Saturday, some of the guys scaled the Superior Hiking Trail near Lake Superior. Mosquitoes, tired legs, and sore bodies were just the candy-coating for a very memorable trip. We left Friday night, camped out by the great lake, hiked all day on Saturday, and spent the night at the top of the mountains. And to top it all off, we had a sunrise Sunday Worship Service with God's beautiful creation as our backdrop!
