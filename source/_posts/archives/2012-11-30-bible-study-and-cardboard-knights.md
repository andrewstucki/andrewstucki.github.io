title: 'Bible Study and "Cardboard Knights"'

---

Hey everyone! Hope you guys all had a great week and great Thanksgiving Break. Just a quick heads up that we'll be having bible study back at the usual time and place. As usual, we'll have dinner, and as usual, we'll have a fun post-TFN activity.

This week, for our post-TFN activity, we'll be playing a really fun game Â called "Cardboard Knights." Not sure what it is? Check out [this video](https://vimeo.com/31572247) from our sister group in Riverside when they played it. It's going to be a blast!
