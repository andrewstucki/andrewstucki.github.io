title: 'RECAP: Brother''s Bible Study 2/22/13'

PT's message on facing our fears with God found a practical application in the gym later that night. The mood tends towards intensity when all the brothers of A2F get together to compete in one gym. Ultimate Frisbee  kickball, and the American Gladiators classic: "Powerball" were the trials of the night. And though they may not look like gladiators, there was enough fighting spirit to go around. Team cheers and guttural shouts filled the gym as blue and red battled out the night. We were sore at the end, but also shared the stories and laughs of our victories and our defeats.
