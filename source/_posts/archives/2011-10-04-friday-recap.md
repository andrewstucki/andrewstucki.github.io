title: 'Friday Recap'

This past Friday, we had a very special post-TFN activity. For the girls, it was what looked like a very entertaining and creative bake-off at Pastor Timothy and Alice's home! For the guys, we went to Van Cleve gym for a good ole' fashion 4-on-4 basketball tournament! A night of two very different forms of competition, but we were all winners. Here are some pictures from our [flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/gpminneapolis/) page.
