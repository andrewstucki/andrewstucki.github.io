title: 'SCT and MYT at TFN...FTW!'

---

What do all of these acronyms mean? Let me break it down for you! We will be resuming our New Testament Survey this Friday at our TFN bible study, followed by our Multiply Your Talents post-TFN activity! How awesome is that!? Now that you know, hope to see you there on Friday. We will be at our usual room in Coffman at the usual time, and as usual, we will start the evening off with a nice home-cooked meal.
