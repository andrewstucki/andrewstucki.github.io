title: 'SIGN UPS: Winter Retreat (January 25-27)'

---

Its that time again! Our annual Winter Retreat is right around the corner (well...next semester) and we are starting to take sign ups. You don't want to miss this once-a-year retreat! It'll be a great time to spend a weekend away from the stresses of school and the craziness of life and spend quality time in fellowship as well as with God. 

We will provide more details as they come, but if you know for sure you can make it, sign up today!
