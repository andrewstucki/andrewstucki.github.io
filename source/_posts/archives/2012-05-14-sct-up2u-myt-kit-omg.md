title: 'Summer Cross Training Kickoff'

It is time to kick off our Summer Cross Training! This Friday, 7PM at D House, we will ring in the New Testament survey in place of our usual TFN bible studies. This Friday will also mark the start of our many other summer activities and challenges like Memorize40, Heroes of Faith, and Running the Race. Still haven't signed up yet? Never fear! You can [do so here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dHozSnZ6YVc0UnQzOElxMUMwMFFRVEE6MQ#gid=0  ).
