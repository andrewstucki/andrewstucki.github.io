Wow, can't believe it's the third week of school already.  Hope you're all setting into your new class schedules!  Come take a study break with us this Friday night at the acts2fellowship Spotlight!  It's a great night to check out our fellowship and see what we're all about.  We'll start with a delicious free dinner, watch a video/skit, hear from Pastor Tim about God's perspective, and end with some fun games and prizes!  Hope to see you there!

P.S.  For those of you in a LIFE group (or want to join), we'll start at the same time/place and just meet over dinner :)
