title: 'Summer Film Fest Entry #1 - Stand Together'

---

Here is the first of three installments for our A2F/IUSM combined Summer Film Fest! The theme was "The Soul of the Early Church," and our first video is brought to you by Annemie, Kathleen, Angela, Allison, Sarah, Theo, Mervyn, and Frankie! Consider this their take on the Kung Fu classics (realistic dubbing and all). Good job guys!
