Tonight, we will be kicking off our LIFE Groups, which is our version of small groups (see trailer for more information). It will be at 6PM at Keller 3-210 (the Engineering building). If you would like to sign up, and haven't done so, go ahead and click the link on your left. Then join us tonight, and we can get you plugged in right away! Afterwards, we will have our usual TFN Bible Study starting with dinner at 7PM also at Keller 3-210. And for our post-TFN activity, we will be heading over to Goldy's Gameroom for Bowling and Ice Cream! This will be free for all students, so be sure to join us, and tell your friends as well. See you guys tonight!
