title: 'Weekly Evangelism Training'

---

For the summer, we will be having weekly Evangelism Training times on Wednesdays at 7PM in Moos 2-530 (same room as prayer meeting). It will be a great time of equipping and learning how to share your faith with your friends and classmates! There is no need to sign up, just drop on by if you are interested in joining us and can make it.

As usual, if you have any questions, feel free to drop a line or ask one of the staff.
