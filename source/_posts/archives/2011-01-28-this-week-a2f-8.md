As announced, we'll be starting off the semester with an exciting new five-part message series, "Finding Faith Thru Film."  Join us as we look for biblical themes, values, and lessons in some of the Hollywood blockbusters that we know and love.  Afterwards, we'll be heading over to the North Gym at the Rec Center for a Dodgeball tournament!  The tournament will also last five weeks, so be sure to come back each week, and bring your friends!
