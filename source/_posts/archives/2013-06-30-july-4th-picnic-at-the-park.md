Happy (soon to be) 4th of July! To celebrate Independence Day, we will be having a pot luck picnic at [Fort Snelling State Park](http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/fort_snelling/index.html) at 3pm. It'll be a day filled with sports, games, fishing, and fireworks at night! If you would like to come, please drop a comment or contact one of the staff. And if you would like to bring a delicious dish to the pot luck, you can [sign up](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1D12IiXZO-jCgR3-7XDWVH9HC1ouqA9SsHnxNtEcByUU/viewform) for a side dish or dessert.
