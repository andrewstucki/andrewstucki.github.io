We are going to be starting up our DT groups this semester! For those of you who don't know, "DT" stands for "Devotion Time," and it is where many of our members spend some time reading God's Word daily. If you would like to get started and follow along with all of our churches across the world, you can do so [here](http://www.gracepointdevotions.org/).

Anyways, we wanted to get an idea of what times work out best for you guys, so if you could help us out by filling out this [form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dEtHV0ZMMFRBR1A1d2tvLTd3alQ1UUE6MQ). After we gather everyone's availability, we will let you know what times we will be meeting up throughout the week. Thanks!
