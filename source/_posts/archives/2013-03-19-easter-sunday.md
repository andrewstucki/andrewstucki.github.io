title: 'Easter Sunday'

---

We will be celebrating Easter this coming Sunday at Gracepoint Church, located right on campus at "The Whole" in Coffman! We will be having our service, a special Easter message, as well as a time of fellowshipping over dinner. It will start at 2PM. If you are not sure where "The Whole" is, it is located in the basement level of Coffman by the computer lab. See you all there as we celebrate together!
