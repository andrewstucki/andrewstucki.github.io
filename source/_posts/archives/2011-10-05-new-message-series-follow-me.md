Don't be fooled, it is not a new acts2fellowship twitter account! This is actually the theme of our new TFN message series called "Follow Me." We will be going through the gospel of Luke, where we read about how Jesus' invitation for the disciples (and for us) to join him. As usual, we will be starting our bible study with dinner and "jumpstart" time. You won't want to miss it!

Like we always do, we will end our night with a fun post-TFN activity. What will it be for this week you may ask? Why don't we ask John and John?

That's right! We will be having a photo scavenger hunt! So be sure to stick around afterwards, and it will be guaranteed that we will make some more memories much like we did [last year](http://www.flickr.com/photos/gpminneapolis/sets/72157625151654988/).
