This week, the Bible Study is on Friday night at 325 Coffman, as usual.  Afterwards, we're heading to Pastor Timothy's house for some group games!  The last time I played Guesstures, I had to act out "Flamingo" in ten seconds, but I pulled it off!  If you think you can do better, I'll see you tonight!
