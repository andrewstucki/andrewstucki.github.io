Can you believe it? We are just one week away from the end of the school year! Finals (unfortunately) are right around the corner, but before we tear off those shrink-wraps and finally open up that textbook for the first time all semester, we will have a Year-End TFN this Friday. We will look back at all that has happened this past year, celebrate in our own unique way ::hint hint::, and spend time in fellowship with one another before summer comes. As usual, we will have dinner and bible study beforehand, so you definitely do not want to miss this Friday!
