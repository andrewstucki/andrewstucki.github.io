Hope you all had a blast this past weekend celebrating the Fourth of July!  This week, we'll be meeting at our usual time, Friday, 6:30 pm.  But just to change things up again, we'll be in Coffman **ROOM 324** instead of 303.  Please note the location change, and we'll see you there!

By the way, the text this week will be [Philippians 2:1-11](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=phil%202:1-11&amp;version=NIV).
