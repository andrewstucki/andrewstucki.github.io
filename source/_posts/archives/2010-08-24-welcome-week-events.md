Everyone knows Welcome Week can be a bit boring if you just go to the mandatory stuff *yawn*, but we've got the perfect cure.  Come check out one of our many exciting events--we've got something going on almost every day!  As always, you can expect tons of friends, fun, and free food!

Of course, if you had to pick only one thing, the must-see extravaganza is our New Student Welcome Night at the Coffman Theater.  We pull out all the stops, including rockin' live music, hilarious video/skit, a thought-provoking talk, and FREE Korean BBQ!  Come join us and bring a friend.  Or two.  Or the rest of your dorm floor.  The more the merrier!
