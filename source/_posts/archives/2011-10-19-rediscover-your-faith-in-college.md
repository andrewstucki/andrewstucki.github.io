Ever felt like Christianity never really answered your questions? Feel like Christianity is too restrictive? Have you grown uninterested, or simply burnt out?

If you feel tired of your Christian walk or haven’t checked out a church in a while, then we hope you can come to this event **this Friday**. It’s rather shocking that 70% of Christians who enter into college will lose their faith before they graduate. We’re hoping that this event — filled with testimonies of stories much like yours — will encourage you to really pursue after God and to learn more about Christianity during your stay in college. "Rediscover" will be happening at 7PM at the President's Room (Coffman 3rd Floor). Hope you can invite your friends to this special talk!
