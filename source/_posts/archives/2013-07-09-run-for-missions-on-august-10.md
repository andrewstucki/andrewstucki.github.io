Gracepoint Minneapolis will be hosting a "Run for Missions" to help raise money for various Mission Trips that our church will be a part of. You can join us for a 5K, 10K, or Half-Marathon (whatever you feel like doing)! Stay tuned for more updates and information on time and location, but in the meantime, hope you all get out there and start running!

If you need a friend (or friends) to run with, we will be continuing to have our Tuesday and Thursday group runs at 6PM down at the East River Flats.
