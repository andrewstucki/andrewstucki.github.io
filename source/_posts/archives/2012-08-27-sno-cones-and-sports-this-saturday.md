title: 'Sno Cones and Sports this Saturday'

---

This Saturday, join us for an action-packed afternoon of sports, topped off with an ice-cold sno cone! We will be at the Northrop Mall from 3-6PM playing ultimately frisbee, soccer, football, and basically anything else we can manage. So bring a friend, bring a crew, and bring your "A" game!
