---

Welcome to Acts 2 Fellowship! We are a campus Christian fellowship, and we will be getting the new year off to a good start with our annual Winter Kickoff! A night filled with skits, music, friendly faces, a special message, and of course...FREE KOREAN BBQ! 

This is definitely the event you wont want to miss this winter! Whether you are a new student or have been around, we invite any and all U of M students who would like to join us.
