This Friday night Bible Study is at 7:00pm in the President's Room on Coffman's 3rd floor!  We hope you'll join us for dinner and a thought-provoking message.  Afterwards, we'll be preparing for our annual Thanksgiving Celebration!  Thanksgiving is a very treasured and unique time of the year here at A2F, so whether you're heading home for Thanksgiving or sticking around, we hope you'll celebrate it with us early on Nov. 17 with a banquet and special performances.
