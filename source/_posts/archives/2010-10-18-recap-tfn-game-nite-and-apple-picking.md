Wow, another fun-filled weekend at a2f!  We started off The Friday Night with some exciting new ice-breaker games led by Andrew, involving Oreos, #2 pencils, and a lot of laughs.  More after the jump!

Andrew introduced a new realm of games to us with A Minute to Win It, where teams compete against one another to complete tasks in under one minute.

First, our lucky contestants had to flip a bunch of pencils from the back of their hand and grab it with the same hand without letting any of them fall to the ground.

Then, we had another round pitting contestants against one another to see who could move the most number of Oreos from their forehead into their mouth--using only their facial muscles!

As you can see, there was plenty of coaching from the audience.

Congrats to Edmond who won, hands down, with a grand total of two cookies consumed!

After cleaning up many fallen Oreos, we settled down to study the second half of the encounter between Jesus and the woman at the well in John 4.  It's the second message in our current series, Encounters With Jesus, through which we will examine fascinating accounts of people who spoke with Christ, and what their conversations reveal about them and us.

After TFN, we packed up and headed over to Van Cleve park down the street, where we stayed in our game teams and played handball, musical basketball, and of course Braveheart.

On Saturday, we met up for a quick lunch and went to Homestead Orchards to pick apples!
