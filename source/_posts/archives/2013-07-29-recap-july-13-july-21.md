Here is a recap of the previous 2 weeks by Joseph and Roy:

7/13 Saturday
We had a warm welcome for Hubert coming from Berkeley with a big potluck dinner at J.K.L’s house. It was only for IUSM and some Ozone bros but according to J.K.L, we had enough food to feed the church.

7/17 Wednesday
We put what we learned from evangelism training into practice. We went out by groups and get to know new students around campus. After that, we had a prayer walk for the U campus and all the students we are about to meet in the fall.

7/20 Sat  
On Saturday we went to Taylor Fall State Park to kayak and canoe. It was so fun and memorable because some of our canoe tipped over and we fell into the water. Even though some of us lost our phones, we gained this precious memory. 

In the evening, we had a welcome dinner for our precious brother and sister, Hubert and Christina, who moved all the way from California to here. And it is Christina’s first time here in Minnesota! We are so thankful that they decided to come and we are so encouraged by their decision and obedience to God. 

They will be joining IUSM and we look forward to bonding relationship with them and doing ministry together! 

Welcome to Minne-snow-ta Hubert and Christina!
