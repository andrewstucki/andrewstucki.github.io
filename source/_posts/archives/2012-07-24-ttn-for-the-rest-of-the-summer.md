title: 'TTN for the Rest of the Summer'

---

Hi guys! Starting this week, we will be meeting for bible study on Thursday nights for the rest of the summer. With bible studies earlier in the week, it will give us a free Friday night to hang out and fellowship with one another.

This Friday, we will be watching the Olympic Opening Ceremonies together! It will be at D House at 7, so if you need a ride, please contact one of the staff or leave a comment.

But before that, we'll see you this Thursday at Coffman 303 for bible study. Have a great week everyone!
