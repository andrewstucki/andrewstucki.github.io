title: 'TFN is back on Friday'

---

Well, we had a nice little change of pace last week with TFN being moved to Thursday, but things are back to normal for this week! We will be back on campus at Coffman 303 @ 7PM. This week, however, we have a really special TFN. It will be the first Friday for a couple of new staff members who just moved out this week from California, Josiah and Angela! And for this Friday, Josiah will be bringing us a testimonial bible study. It will be a great chance to meet them and hear their story, so hope to see you there!
